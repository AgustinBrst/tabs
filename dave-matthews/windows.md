### Tab

Dave tends to add color to the chords with subtle strums or picking patterns, changing from section to section. To keep the tab simple, all those little variations are not included, but check the video for reference.

### Lyrics

When the war is over  
And we go back to everyday, everyday  
Will it be the same again  
When you've been turned inside out and outside in?  

Singing from the windows  
Shadow on the wall, the way they dance  
Not much of nothing  
And look at this fire burning bright  

Look at how the children play  
None of us know what's to come tomorrow  
But I'm not going out today  
So dance with me like the time we've got is borrowed  

Singing from the windows  
Sirens in the dark, where are you going?  
Pretend that it's nothing  
But look at this fire burning wild  

Well this is how we keep holding on  
Every day, all day long  
But sometimes things just fall apart  
No matter how you try, they won't stop  

Singing from the windows  
Something outside and I don't know  

When the storm is over  
Picking up the pieces of everyday  
Memories in picture frames  
Trying to put the inside out and the outside in  

Singing from the windows  
Walking down the hall, nowhere to go  
It'd be good to see you  
Suppose when it's all said and done  

This is how we keep holding on  
All the days, all day long  
But sometimes things just fall apart  
No matter how we try, they can't stop  

Singing from the windows  
Voices outside and no one knows  
Singing from the windows  
We'll get going again  

When the war is over
