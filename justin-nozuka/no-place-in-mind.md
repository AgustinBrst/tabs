### Lyrics

`[Verse]`  
Moonlight through my window  
In my bed I lay awake  
My mind already made  
I'm out the door tomorrow  

`[Verse]`  
I'm gonna walk  
With no particular place in mind  
Just a bag this time  
Some clothes  
And a brush for my teeth  

`[Pre-chorus]`  
Oh, walk by the road and track  
Oh, just a bag on my back  

`[Chorus]`  
I hit the road  
No place in mind  
No idea won't know just what I might find  
Melodies and trees  
Hang by my side  
Knowing it's all I need now  
All the symmetry  
It makes me wonder  
Could it carry me through  
Dark days of summer  

`[Verse]`  
I thought of nothing  
As I walked down to the lake  
The silence didn't break  
I sat for hours there  

`[Verse]`  
I skipped a rock and then  
Oh, I jumped in  
Boy, I love to swim  
Yeah, I will not get out  

`[Pre-chorus]`  
Oh, lie here until the sun goes down  
Oh, all the stars that I found  

`[Chorus]`  
I hit the road  
No place in mind  
No idea won't know just what I might find  
Melodies and trees  
Hang by my side  
Knowing it's all I need now  
All the symmetry  
It makes me wonder  
Could it carry me through  
Dark days of summer  

`[Bridge]`  
Oh, I'm out here hey  
Far away  
From the modern style  
Oh, Peru, Lyon  
I wont be home for  
Quite a while  

`[Chorus]`  
I hit the road  
No place in mind  
No idea won't know just what I might find  
Melodies and trees  
Hang by my side  
Knowing it's all I need now  
All the symmetry  
It makes me wonder  
Could it carry me through  
Dark days of summer  

`[Chorus]`  
I hit the road  
No place in mind  
No idea won't know just what I might find  
Melodies and trees  
Hang by my side  
Knowing it's all I need now  
All the symmetry  
It makes me wonder  
Could it carry me through  
Dark days of summer
